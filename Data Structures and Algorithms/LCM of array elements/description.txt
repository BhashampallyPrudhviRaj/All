Problem
Given n integers, a0,a1,...an−1.

Find the smallest common multiple (LCM), the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all of them.

###Input:

The first line contains a single integer, T, denoting the number of test cases. The 2*T subsequent lines describe each test query in the following form:
The first line contains an integer, n denoting the number of elements. The second line contains n space-separated positive integers describing their respective values, a0,a1,...an−1
 
###Output: For each test case, print a single integer denoting the required LCM in a new line
