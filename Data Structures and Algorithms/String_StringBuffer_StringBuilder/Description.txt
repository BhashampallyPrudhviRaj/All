String:
String is immutable and whenever we do any operations on strings then new objects are created and old objects are collected by Garbage Collector.


StringBuffer and StringBuilder:
StringBuffer and StringBuilder are almost same and works on the same object which is initially created without creating new objects.

StringBuffer is thread-safe whereas StringBuilder is not thread-safe.
